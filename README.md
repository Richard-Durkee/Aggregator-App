# Aggregator-App

Link to Vercel Deployment: 
https://aggregator-app-kappa.vercel.app/

To run my Aggregator locally, run "create-react-app aggregator-app" from the terminal, and then navigate to 
"http://localhost:3000/" on your default browser.

Before doing that, you may need to run the following:
"npm install"
"npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled"
"npm install @fontsource/roboto"

Known Bugs:

My reset button does not clear the text on the Select dropdown box for sorting selection.
